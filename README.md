# Stateless Password Generator
The Stateless Password Generator is a free password generator that utilizes Master Password algorithms to calculate passwords based on your preferences. It does not store any of your data; instead, you only need to remember your master password rather than maintaining multiple passwords for each website. It operates independently, requiring no external connections.
