# Stateless Password Generator
The Stateless Password Generator is a free password generator that utilizes Master Password algorithms to calculate passwords based on your preferences. It does not store any of your data; instead, you only need to remember your master password rather than maintaining multiple passwords for each website. It operates independently, requiring no external connections.

You can install this tool via [Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stateless-password-manage/cfmcfaddoadgpdnhbnofmbnhooigchlk)
